<h2>How to run the project:</h2>

Clone the repo to your machine, then run the command 'npm i' to install all libraries.

Then, you have to create your own database using postgres, the dump of the database can be found in the root folder.

After you created you database, you have to set the .env.test archive up, there is an .en.example, it will show you everything that need to be in the .env.test archive.

next thing you need to do is to run 'npm start' on your console and it's all set.

Then, you have to get the front of this project running, you can find it here
